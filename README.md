# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## Overview
In this project, I analyze the famous Titanic dataset to determine the key factors influencing passenger survival. Using Python and data analysis tools, I explore relationships between passenger demographics, ticket class, family size, and survival rates.

## Key Findings 📊
- **Family Size**: Smaller families (1-3 members) had higher survival rates, while those traveling alone or in larger families faced lower chances of survival.
- **Gender and Class**: Women and first-class passengers had significantly higher chances of survival.
- **Embarkation Port**: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg tended to have a wider range of fares, and a notable percentage survived compared to other ports.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
